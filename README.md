# PlantVillage Dataset

## Overview

The PlantVillage Dataset contains a collection of high-quality images of plant leaves. The dataset is designed for research in plant disease detection and classification. Each image is labeled with the corresponding plant species and the health condition of the leaf (e.g., healthy, diseased).

## Dataset Structure

The dataset is organized into subdirectories for each plant species. Within each species directory, there are further subdirectories for each health condition. The structure is as follows:
